# Project Code Guide
This directory contains all the necessary code for conducting experiments. Each script has comments on all methods, functions, and classes. 

## Description of scripts
- [`dataloader.py`](https://github.com/Daniilmipt007/Forecasting-fMRI-Images/blob/main/code/dataloader.py) contains the `FramesLoader` class, which has methods for capturing images from a video sequence, primary processing and vectorization of images using the pre-trained ResNet-152 architecture. It also contains the `Sub` class for capturing fMRI images in the form of tensors for a specific number of the subject. The dataset can be downloaded [here](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003688/versions/1.0.7). Please note that to use the code, you need to put the data in the `src` folder (in the root directory).
- [`models.py`](https://github.com/Daniilmipt007/Forecasting-fMRI-Images/blob/main/code/models.py) includes the `Preprocessor` class, designed for preprocessing the data used in the model. The class divides the sample into training and test samples, taking into account the parameter `dt` (hemodynamic reaction time). In addition, the script contains a key linear model `LinearDeltaModel`, which predicts the difference between the current and the next fMRI scan. It is worth noting that `LinearModel` is a basic model that is outdated and is not recommended for use.
- [`visualizer.py`](https://github.com/Daniilmipt007/Forecasting-fMRI-Images/blob/main/code/visualizer.py) contains the `Visualizer` class for visualizing slices of fMRI images, as well as visualizing the results of model prediction. 
- [`utils.py`](https://github.com/Daniilmipt007/Forecasting-fMRI-Images/blob/main/code/utils.py) contains functions for calculating metrics, downloading and saving binary files.
- [`main.ipynb`](https://github.com/Daniilmipt007/Forecasting-fMRI-Images/blob/main/code/main.ipynb) includes all the experiments described in the paper. Examples of the use of each of the above methods, classes, and functions are provided here.
